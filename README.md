# Korean-name-translator

This is a simple web app designed to convert Korean characters (Hangeul) to romanized english characters.

Hangul.js is a JavaScript library that separates consonants and vowels in Korean sentences. I'm using this to disect the korean name inputs before converting them to english. 

The app also comes with a cute drum roll gif because why not?!

If you find any bugs in the codes or issues with the translation please let me know, or better yet send me a pull request!
