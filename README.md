# Korean-name-translator

This will initially start as a web app that translates Korean names into romanized letters, 
however I'll be adding functionality to allow conversion of english names to Korean once I fiugure that out. 


Hangul.js is a JavaScript library that separates consonants and vowels in Korean sentences. I'm using this to disect the korean name inputs before converting them to english. 

If you find any bugs in the codes or issues with the translation please let me know, or better yet send me a pull request!
